1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user need was this app designed to address?

This program's objectives were to create working software that utilized a database in order to maintain daily inventory, a target thereby affecting them, and a username and password for logging in. The application ought to enable users to log in or sign up with a single option, adding them to the user/password record if they have not yet been there. The user ought to be able to erase and look up the inventory. The target value ought to just be initialized and then changed. This was developed to satisfy the user's demands of tracking daily inventory and comparing it to an objective. Whenever the user approaches the target, the application should notify them. Because of the time limits, this section fails to function in my application, but the remainder does.

2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Login, home, history, add record, set/edit goal, and authorization were all required screens. This provided each screen with a main purpose, making the software simple to operate. My designs were created with the users in consideration, providing them with something simple and nice to communicate with. There can be no doubt about what the screens are for or the best way to use them.

3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

Programming my app was difficult. I began with the user interface. After that, I proceeded on to database management systems and Java. I first tried using pieces and instances. This succeeded to a certain degree, but incorporating database operations that affected specific fragments was extremely time-consuming. The second choice that I selected was to engage in activities. This performed much better because every task had its own Java class that allowed me to alter the presentation and information. I intend to employ this in the future because it makes my job as a coder a lot easier. I ultimately figured out the fragmented, dynamic population, but I couldn't delete anything from the database since the IDs never corresponded.

4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I primarily tested the program by executing it on emulators. I ought to have done more JUnit tests, but time gets distracted with schoolwork. I also made significant use of toasts to draw attention to when actions were successfully finished. This approach indicates where the code is failing, which is crucial since you want to understand how it will behave in the grasp of an actual cellphone user. I'm sure there's room for development, but as far as first applications go, I think it turned out very well.

5. Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I have to get creative with the database functions.  This required a long time, but it ultimately labored. It was necessary to be allowed to determine what items were removed from that list, and I couldn't figure out the best way to call the identification number of a single instance of an element and then use it in the database's procedure. I wound up just creating unpopulated targets and then filling them periodically so that I could separate my goals as needed.

6. In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?


I am convinced the UI was the most effective place for me to show off my abilities. I believe the back end should be improved, particularly the loops, but the user interface is clean and basic from my perspective. In my instance, I also believe the login performed quite nicely. For security reasons, I took it upon myself to incorporate cryptography and only save passwords in encrypted form, which I believe demonstrated my capacity to modify code and learn rapidly.
